This project extracts and analyzes gene sequences from GenBank files (.gbff) and retrieves corresponding protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). It includes:

-Extracting gene sequences using GeneID

-Translating DNA sequences to RNA and proteins

-Identifying start/stop codons and coding sequences (CDS)

-Downloading and parsing PDB files

-Extracting amino acid sequences and ligand information

About rotavirus:

Rotavirus is a double-stranded RNA virus that primarily infects the intestines of mammals and birds. It is a leading cause of gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide, leading to severe diarrhea and dehydration. The VP7 gene encodes the VP7 protein, a major structural component of the virus's outer capsid. This protein is important for the virus's ability to infect host cells.

P.S:

NCBI GenBank files (with the .gbff extension) typically represent sequences in DNA format, regardless of the type of virus or organism. This includes RNA viruses like Rotavirus. When analyzing RNA viruses, we convert the DNA sequence into RNA format by replacing thymine (T) with uracil (U) in the sequence. This is important because the RNA sequence is the functional genome for RNA viruses.
